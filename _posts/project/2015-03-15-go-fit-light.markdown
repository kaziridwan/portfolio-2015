####GoFit Light
A pedometer and fitness tracking app for android platform. I developed the admin panel and API
endpoint.

####Contributions
- Server Configuration (cloud)
- Backend Development
- API development, maintaining the REST-ful standard
- Api integrations 
   GCM push notification

####Technologies used
A. Backend
   - Laravel PHP framework on LEMP stack and several libraries

####Methodologies
1. Backend Development
   - Maintained the project with git in an agile workflow
2. API Development
   - Followed strict guidelines to implement the API in REST-ful manner

####Remarks
- The landing page had to be designed carefully with the app statistics,
  so, I had to come up with 10 different statistics present as graphs and charts,
  which will give the admin panel on various aspects of their apps, such as
  its popularity and impact on the users, which will help them to predict their 
  future and aid them in making future decisions.
