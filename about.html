            <h4>More About Me.</h4>
            <p>I am an app developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>I started to work on web, at first as a frontend developer and designer. Then later moved on backend.</p>
            <p>These days, I am also working on mobile platforms, mainly on HTML5 mobile apps.</p>
            <p>
                Apart from these I am equally interested in robotics, embedded technology, and even game development. 
                I am a very curious person, and I try to take lessons from everthing I experience. And that photo!!! well its just a pun, I am not a hero, literally.
